    <h1>How to make a toasted Toaster</h1>
    <img src="../images/toaster.jpg">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A toasted toaster is a well known human delicacy that have been found across all cultures.
    The remains of human civilisation have shown that these creatures would often partake in communal style 
    cookery, where toasted toasters would be distributed among all the members of their social groups.
     The hard crust of the toaster implies that the 'teeth' of humans were very tough as to allow for the breakdown
      of these sources of nutrients. While our observations can only peek into the lives of these primitive creatures we may need 
      to simulate the processing of these toasters in varying conditions to see whether there are other methods in which to make this
      food source palatable.

    <ol>
        <li>The toaster is first tenderised with the use of fire and some source of carbon to add flavour, this may have come from the local 'gurass' vegetation that existed during their time although the state of current fossils make it difficult to determine exactly what was used.</li>
        <li>As we have learned from their recipe books humans would often add seasonings and other additive to enhance flavour or increase nutrient extraction. Salt and pepper is a well known seasonings in human culture, the process of seasoning is known as extreme raring as opposed to medium raining which refers to the process of boiling in rainwater.</li>
